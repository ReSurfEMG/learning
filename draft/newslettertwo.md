ReSurfEMG Newsletter #2: Free live tutorial - online and in person!

We are happy to announce a free live tutorial you can join on Zoom or in person for anyone who wants to move forward in computer skills for working with the ReSurfEMG package! For more details on what will be covered look [here](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning/blob/main/biosignals_tutorial.md). The event will happen on February 17th from 14:30 until 16:00 pm as part of the Biosignals conference. You will need Zoom to participate remotely, so please contact us for the Zoom link (c.moore@esciencecenter.nl). 

To get the most from the tutorial, it is very important that you prepare your laptop (check our [learning repository](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning) for the requirements in general and the [biosignals tutorial page](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning/blob/main/biosignals_tutorial.md) for specific instructions). Even if you are unable to accomplish this, you will be able to watch the tutorial, and get a lot out of it. However, we are more than willing to meet you before hand for a tech-check session. Please email c.moore@esciencecenter.nl to schedule one. 

We hope everyone without a lot of version control experience will come to the tutorial, which will also cover topics like how to work with our library without coding. Although there is some functionality of ReSurfEMG you can use without code, we think it's never a bad time to know how to get more out of the tool by working with code. 
If the whole subject of version control is unclear to you, or you have never even seen code, then our tutorial will be a great introduction. Many issues we will cover in the tutorial, such as creating reproducible work, are relevant beyond the subject area of surface EMG. We hope to see you there!
