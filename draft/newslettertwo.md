ReSurfEMG Newsletter # 2: "Git" it done 

We are happy to announce a free live tutorial in February for participants and friends who want to move forward in the computer programming skills needed to work with the ReSurfEMG package! You can join the tutorial via Zoom or live at the Biosignals 2023 conference in Lisbon. For more details on what will be covered look [here](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning/blob/main/biosignals_tutorial.md). 
We hope everyone without a lot of version control experience will come to the tutorial, which will also cover topics like how to work with our library without coding. 
We are however, big fans of version control.
Many people, from clinicians to weary educators to engineers fresh out of school, wonder what programming language they need to learn to break into AI and/or computationally driven research. One awnser surprises and dissapoints them. It's nor Python, or R or Julia; it's Git. As Dr. Moore recently explained to some students in AI, increasinly everyone from pharmacists to psychologists to even high school students can do some programming on the level of writing simple scripts. That means that given enough time they can copy-paste their wau to a notebook of machine learning. So why can't these copy-pasters do anything that actually accomplishes much? Because they lack certain obvious and neccesary skills.
 One of the critical skills that seperates people who can copy code from professionals, i.e. the people who could actually accomplish writing important code for research, is knowing how to use version control. Version control is a must-have because complex programs that involve signal processing and machine learning are rarely written by a single person. Furthermore most of the people asking me how to get into programming do not actually aspire to do much programming (or they wouldn't if they understood how boring it might be), they simply want thier ideas realized. For them it would be more exciting to direct a group of talented programmers, than waste hours debugging their own code. They really want to work effectively with programmers, not be programmers. On a day to day basis being effective at this kind of collaboration requires tasks like examining newly written code and perhaps adding documentation. These tasks are possible without mastering version control, much in the way it is possible to get from Paris to Jerusalem for a meeting by walking. Just as your colleagues aren't going to tolerate rescheduling a meeting for your year long pilgramage when you could just get on Zoom, your future colleagues in programming, shouldn't tolerate you writing documentation suggestions in an email, or asking for help every time you want to examine a new patch to the code.
