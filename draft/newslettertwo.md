ReSurfEMG Newsletter # 2: Free live tutorial online and in person!

We are happy to announce a free live tutorial you can join on Zoom or in person in February for participants and friends who want to move forward in computer skills for working with the ReSurfEMG package! For more details on what will be covered look [here](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning/blob/main/biosignals_tutorial.md). The event will happen on February 17th from 14:30 until 16:00. You will need Zoom to participate remorely, so please contact us for the Zoom link (c.moore@esciencecenter.nl). 
It is very important that to get the most from the tutorial you come to the tutorial with your laptop prepared (you are signed up to Github, have an IDE, and have conda or mamba and git, and have loaded ReSurfEMG onto your machine). Even if you are unable to accomplish this, you will be able to watch the tutorial, and get a lot out of it. However, we are more than willing to meet you before hand for a tech-check session. Please email candace.moore@sciencecenter.nl to schedule one. We strongly encourage you to come prepared.

We hope everyone without a lot of version control experience will come to the tutorial, which will also cover topics like how to work with our library without coding. 

Although there is some functionality of ReSurfEMG you can use without code, we think it's never a bad time to know how to get more out of the tool by working with code. In fact in science in general, researchers could do a lot more if they knew how to get the most from their computing machines. But where to start?

If the whole subject of version control is unclear to you, or you have never even seen code, then showing up at our tutorial in Biosignals will be a great introduction. This is a tutorial for the whole surface EMG community, including people with difficulties with computers. Further many issues we will cover in the tuorial such as creating reproducible work are relevant beyond the subject area of surface EMG. We hope to see you there!
