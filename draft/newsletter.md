ReSurfEMG Newsletter # 1: The Suggested Stack

Welcome to the ReSurfEMG newsletter. You will sporadically recieve this newsletter before the upcoming conference. The information contained within will allow you to get the most out of the conference, and accompanying software.
This edition will focus on basic tool sets for in-depth EMG analysis. Many of you will be familiar with using Matlab or a pre-programmed Excel spreadsheet. For various reasons these are far from optimal tools for EMG analysis due to their proprietary nature (it makes it much harder to share work across different groups, some of which may not have a license for these specific softwares). When we created the [ReSurfEMG library](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG) we aimed to create open tools which could be used across all groups working in the resiratory EMG area. 
Everyone can share and contribute to our package even if they are not able to code in Python. However as our software is written in Python we want to send some tips to those among you enthusiastic about working with the code itself.
We have already noted varying levels of skills in terms of working with Python and various other building blocks neccesary to get the maximum use of of the library among participcapts. Therefore we have opened a [learning repository](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning). We also have a suggested stack of tools for those entirely new to writing Python:

Reccomended Integrated Development Environment (IDE): VSCode 

        Alternative IDEs: Pycharm, IDLE etc. 

Reccomended Package Manager: Conda/Anaconda

        Alternative Package Managers: Pip(not reccomended), Mamba (will take effort and lots of knowledge)

Version control (VC): Git

        Alternative VC: existing VC was done in GIt so the only alternative at this point we can imaging is Perforce (not reccomended because nobody in the core teams will know how to help you, good thing you are a genius)

While there is some flexibility around the IDE for newbies, we highly reccomend you use our prescribed stack if you are relatively new to working with Python. Not only will you be in the same boat as most of the original developers, but by installing with Conda you avoid conflicting packages creating unexpected behaviour (most of the time). 

We expect you to bring a laptop to the conference, and if you have a choice and are new to code, please choose a Windows machine. If you are a seasoned Linux user who loves eMacs, then we have no doubt that you know your way around code, and will need less help. Our code is written to be cross-platform so you can use Linux, Mac or Windows. However for full disclosure we must mention that while Dr. Moore occasionally work on the code from a Linux machine, most people are using Windows, and no one in the core development team uses a Mac yet. If the world of Python is entirely new to you, you would put yourself at an advantage to use the tools used by most of the core development team most of the time. 

We hope to set up individual meetings to explore your level of interest and comfort with not only code, but all the areas covered in the conference.

Welcome!
