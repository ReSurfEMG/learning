ReSurfEMG Newsletter #1: Registration and The Suggested Stack

Welcome to the ReSurfEMG newsletter. You will sporadically receive this newsletter before the upcoming Masterclass (11-14 April 2023). 

--> Within a couple of weeks you will receive the email to officially register for the Masterclass from the Lorentz center. Please keep your eyes open for the email, and register soon after you get it.  
 
--> Many of you will be familiar with using Matlab or a pre-programmed Excel spreadsheet. When we created ReSurfEMG, we aimed to create open tools which could be used across all groups working on respiratory EMG. Although there is the option to tweak all the filter and analysis settings, the software also allows for analysis with custom preprocessing and in the future even a dashboard application.  

Everyone can share and contribute to our software package, even if they are not able to code in Python. However, as our software is written in Python we want to point out some tips to those among you enthusiastic about working with the code itself. Therefore, in our [learning repository](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning) you will find the suggested programs to use the ResurfEMG software, which we will discuss during the Masterclass.

--> We expect you to bring a laptop to the Masterclass, and if you have a choice and are new to code, please choose a Windows machine. 

We hope to set up individual meetings to explore your level of interest and comfort with not only code, but all the areas covered in the Masterclass. We also hope that if you have relevant news you want to share with this community, you will let us know, so that we can include it in the upcoming newsletters.
