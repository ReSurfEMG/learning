ReSurfEMG Newsletter # 1: The Suggested Stack

Welcome to the ReSurfEMG newsletter. You will sporadically recieve this newsletter before the upcoming conference. The information contained within will allow you to get the most out of the conference, and accompanying software.
This edition will focus on basic tool sets for in-depth EMG analysis. Many of you will be familiar with using Matlab or a pre-programmed Excel spreadsheet. For various reasons these are far from optimal tools for EMG analysis due to their proprietary nature (it makes it much harder to share work across different groups, some of which may not have a license for these specific software). When we created the [ReSurfEMG library](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG) we aimed to create open tools which could be used across all groups working in the resiratory EMG area. 
Everyone can share and contribute to our package even if they are not able to code in Python. However as our software is written in Python we want to send some tips to those among you enthusiastic about working with the code itself.
We are happy to have been met with enthusiasm, however we have noted varying levels of skills in terms of working with Python and various other building blocks neccesary to get the maximum use of of the library. Therefore we have opened a learning repository. We also have a suggested stack of tools for those entirely new to writing Python:

Reccomended Integrated Development Environment/IDE: VSCode 

        Alternative IDEs: Pycharm, IDLE etc. 

Reccomended Package manager: Conda/Anaconda

        Alternative package manager: mamba (will take effort and knowledge)

Version control: Git

While there is some flexibility around the IDE for newbies, we highly reccomend you use Conda/Anaconda as  a package manager if you are relatively new to working with Python. By installing with Conda you avoid conflicting packages creating unexpected behaviour (most of the time). 

We expect you to bring a laptop to the conference, and if you have a choice and are new to code, please choose a Windows machine. If you are a seasoned Linux user who loves eMacs,then we have no doubt that you know your way around code, and will need less help. Our code is written to be cross-platform so you can use Linux, Mac or Windows. However if the world of Python is entirely new to you, you would put yourself at an advantage to use the tools used by most of the core development team most of the time. 

We hope to set up individual meetings to explore your level of interest and comfort with not only code, but all the areas covered in the conference.

Welcome!
