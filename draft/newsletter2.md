ReSurfEMG Newsletter # 2: Git it done !

Welcome to the second ReSurfEMG newsletter. As we get ready for the upcoming conference, we are sending information to harmonize and refine our shared understanding of many issues. We hope communication will be a two way street, and you should feel free to be in contact with us about your hopes and desires not only for the conference but more importantly how the field will change and move in the next years. Perhaps a working group will form, there are so many possibilities, but to move the field forward we should move forward in our skills. The cliche that the worker of today must be a life-long learner is true for people who want to advance the science behind clinical technologies in general, and surface EMG specifically.

In the last edition we focused on basic tool sets we can use to work with the digital data from EMGs. We mentioned that we are using Git for Version control. We are very happy to report we had our first cross University Git learning collaboration already! We played a home-made game designed to teach some basic Git commands. It's worth noting that depending upon your machine you can play online games for the same purpose. For people not on Window's machines, we reccomend [OhmyGit!](https://ohmygit.org/). There is also [the Git Game](https://github.com/git-game/git-game) however it has not been updated for almost a decade. Code related to specific implementations in computer code tends to change quickly, so as a general rule of thumb, if you find a library or code base where you see no changes for years, it is safe to assume you are looking at 'abandonware.' 

Beyond the games there is a cornucopia of resources online to help you learn Git. And for those of you who want to learn by doing as quickly as possible, there are even Git cheat sheets!

If you come from a medical background you may want to know two things- the bible, and the online go-to. By bible we meant the accepted standard text for the field, like Harrison's for Internal Medicine, and by online go-to we mean something comparable to uptodate. There is a bible:... but there is no standard online go-to other than the Git glossary itself. There are many sites like stack-overflow from which you can often get quick awnser.

Refining and testing our own way of learning Git, our Git game, is an ongoing project. Reactions to the concept have ranged from "sounds like fun" to "I would sabotage such offensive nonsense." In general the gamification of learning is a trend not without detractors. Some people like learning with games, and other people hate it. There are valid arguments on both sides, and invalid arguments as well. One argument I have heard is that gamification makes learning fun (and we all know learning should involve no fun). In the end many analuses of h                                                                                                                  cow we should be learning often comes down to taste. Whatever you taste, we do highly reccomend you get up to speed on Git. Version control is a fundamental skill for any modern approach to computationally heavy science work.

We would like to give every opportunity to learners to catch up on skills related to Python, Git and working with code. If you have ideas, specific questions or suggestions about learning these skills please be in touch. Additionally, if there are any participants for whom everything related to ode is all a new world, we will make some hours available from our team to yours in order to start catching you up. Please contact Dr. Moore at  c.moore@escienceceneter.nl if you are interested in this. 

If you feel a bit overwhelmed by the amount of technology you must grasp to work with EMG you are not alone. Keep in mind that while this makes the work challenging, it also means we are on the very edge of innovation. We are all finding and discovering new information. What a glorious task.


Keep learning and see you soon!
