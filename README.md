##  ⚡ Suggested programs for working with ReSurfEMG⚡

Recommended Integrated Development Environment (IDE): VSCode  

        Alternative IDEs: Pycharm, IDLE etc.  


Recommended Package Manager: Conda/Anaconda 

        Alternative Package Managers: Pip(not recommended), Mamba (will take effort and lots of knowledge) 


Version control (VC): Git 

        Alternative VC: existing VC was done in Git so the only alternative at this point we can imagine is Perforce (not recommended because nobody in the core teams will know how to help you, good thing you are a genius) 


##  ⚡ Learning Materials⚡

Binders and other resources for learning the basic computational skills needed to understand our work.

For a practical beginner introduction to Python, we reccomend [the software carpentry on Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/). You should also pick up version control as early as possible, we reccomend [this carpentry tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). For some tips on coding on our project, see our [best_practices.md](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning/blob/main/best_practices.md)  file .To learn notebook navigation, as well as more specific tips about ReSurfEMG we reccomend using our Jupyter binders (just click on the badge links like this one: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ReSurfEMG/learning/main)). Did you start tinkering somewhere and make a mistake? See our [fixing_mistakes.md](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning/blob/main/fixing_mistakes.md) file.

We hope to present a [tutorial at Biosignals 2023](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning/blob/main/biosignals_tutorial.md) in February 2023, stay tuned for that.
