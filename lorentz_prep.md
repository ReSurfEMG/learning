# Lorentz center preparation :stethoscope:

To get the most from thr meeting's technical lectures and labs you will need to:

1. To bring your laptop
2. Have an integrated development environment (IDE) e.g. VS Code ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)), already installed on your laptop.
3. If you do not already have conda and/or mamba on your machine, get Anaconda/conda([instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/))
4. Have Git on your laptop [recommended download](https://git-scm.com/)
5. Have a Python 3.8 or above ( if you need to get look [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) )
6. Sign up for [Github](https://github.com/) if you do not have an account. This is where the repository and tutorial material are. 
7. Clone the [ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG) repository onto your machine because the first time you clone a repository will take longer than ever again if you have not been using Git. For this reason we ask you to clone a repo before arriving. You may need to set up git as below:

    Setup git: 

        git config --global user.name <your username>

        git config --global user.email <your valid email>

8. Clone the [dashboard](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG-dashboard)
