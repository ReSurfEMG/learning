ReSurfEMG Newsletter #3: Upcoming Masterclass and preparation

As the Masterclass on respiratory surface EMG is only 1 month away, we would like to draw your attention to the updated program on the [website](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/surface-emg-of-respiratory-muscles-innovative-analyses-to-daily-practice.html) of the Lorentz Center. We are very much looking forward to 4 days of inspiring talks and discussions!

In case you have already used the ReSurfEMG software on [Github](https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG), we are very eager to hear your thoughts and ideas. 
In case you are having trouble working with the program or have questions, dr. Candace Makeda Moore is available every Friday from 2:30PM until 5:30PM to help you out. Please don't hesitate contact her via email (c.moore@esciencecenter.nl) to schedule an online meeting.
